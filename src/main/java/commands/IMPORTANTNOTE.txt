Not sure where else to put this so a text file will have to do.
There are 3 types of commands standard, privileged, and debug.

Standard - Designed for anyone to be able to use them, so long as they have the correct permissions.
Privileged - Only users added to the correct file (/Internals/PrivilegedUsers.txt) may run them.
Debug - The code must be in debug mode for them to be run by anyone.

When running a command of a certain type you need to change the prefix to tell Jimmy what to search for.
Prefixes:
!j - Standard prefix, all most users need to know about.
!j-p - Privileged command.
!j-d - Debug command. Will only run when debug mode is on.
